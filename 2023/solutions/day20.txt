Pulse: hi or lo
Sent to all dest modules

Flip-flops (prefix %): 
state = on/off
ignores hi pulse
flips state on lo; sends hi if switched on, lo if switched off

Conjunctions (prefix &):
- remembers inputs from connected modules, initially lo
- updates signals upon reception
- if all inputs the same, sends corresponding pulse

Single broadcaster:
- sends identical pulse on receiving

Button module controls all:
- single lo sent to broadcaster

Part 2:
- rx to fire a low pulse.
- rx is fed by &hj; for &hj to fire a low pulse, all its latest inputs need to be HIGH pulses.
- inputs to hj are: ks, jf, qs, zk

The inputs to hj do not carry their HI state to the end of the cycle, i.e. at 
the end of each button press cycle, they are back to LO!
